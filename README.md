Notes
* Implementation is done in way that is extendible for other game variations like Japanese or spock game
* Only Classic game is available as complete user journey 
* Spock game is just to show that player moves are dynamic depending on game type 
* Well is not available
* I've applied a couple of design patterns like builder, strategy or factory   

Player can play vs another player 
versus computer 
or computer vs computer 

Issues that can be improved 
* error handling 
* UI form validation 
* code coverage 
* code refactor to provide cleaner code 
* improvements to UI
